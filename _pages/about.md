I am currently a researcher at [the L3S Institute](https://www.l3s.de/the-l3s/), Leibniz University Hannover, Germany.

As a bioinformatics data scientist, I am interested in developing and applying machine learning algorithms to tackle social challenges such as cancer and aging. 
My [most recent project](https://git.l3s.uni-hannover.de/tang/clinALL) is on developing a machine learning assisted clinical framework for oncology data integration, analysis and visualization. This framework is incorporated into routine diagnostics of acute lymphoblastic leukemia, assisting clinicians in patient subtyping and decision-making.

I obtained my PhD from [Johns Hopkins Medical Institute, USA](https://www.hopkinsmedicine.org/), where I used a system biology approach to study the PI3K/PTEN pathway and developed an excitable network model. I obtained a master's degree in Bioinformatics from  [Freie Universität Berlin, Germany](https://www.fu-berlin.de/). My master thesis is on developing deep learning models for peptide acetylation. I obtained my bachelor's degree from [University of Science and Technology, China](https://www.ustc.edu.cn/).
